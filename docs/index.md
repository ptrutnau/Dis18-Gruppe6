# Forscher*innen in Wikidata – MAK

This project explores how researchers and contributors are represented in Wikidata in connection with the Museum für angewandte Kunst (MAK).

We process structured metadata from ORCID and DataCite to enrich Wikidata entries. The result is a clean, reusable dataset of researchers with institutional links, mapped into Wikidata items.

This documentation covers:
- Installation instructions
- Data pipeline overview
- Code structure
- Workflow visualization
- Team responsibilities

The entire project is open source and hosted on GitHub.
